# Simple bash script to restart ath10k kernel modules.
# ath10k is the module responsible for my wifi card and sometimes
# on boot it just won't work even though it shows "connected".
# In this case (that happens 10% of the time), it's enough to restart the module. 

# This script checks if it is possible to ping Cloudflare DNS server (1.1.1.1)
# If it is not possible, it means there is no internet available (the servers are probably not down). 
# Therefore, try to restart ath10k_pci and ath10k_core modules.
# But if it is possible and the problem is DNS (i.e. google.com is not available), restarting ath10k module won't help.

ping -c 1 1.1.1.1 > /dev/null
